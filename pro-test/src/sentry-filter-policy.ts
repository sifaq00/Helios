/**
 * Marketing-surface Sentry filtering policy.
 *
 * `/` (rewritten to `/pro/welcome.html`) and `/pro` render from this bundle,
 * whose Sentry client is a SEPARATE `@sentry/react` init (`./sentry.ts`). The
 * dashboard's ~250-entry `ignoreErrors` array and its `beforeSend` live in
 * `src/bootstrap/sentry-init.ts` and never run here, so browser/extension noise
 * the dashboard has filtered for months still lands as marketing-surface
 * issues. The 2026-08-19 triage found five, every one sent by
 * `sentry.javascript.react` with a null release (the dashboard SDK reports as
 * `sentry.javascript.browser` and always carries `worldmonitor@<version>`):
 * WORLDMONITOR-ZY, -ZX, -ZZ, -ZW and -15. WORLDMONITOR-15 is named in the
 * dashboard's own suppressor comment in `src/bootstrap/sentry-init.ts` — it has
 * been dropped there since #4005 and leaked here the whole time.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a copy of the dashboard array. Those entries were vetted
 * against the dashboard bundle (deck.gl / MapLibre / Convex / IndexedDB);
 * copying them wholesale would suppress messages this React bundle genuinely
 * can emit, which is the exact observability blind spot `ignoreErrors` is
 * supposed to avoid. Only patterns impossible from ANY first-party bundle
 * belong here — anything that could come from our own minified output goes in
 * `marketingBeforeSend` behind the first-party-frame gate instead.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free (no `@sentry/react` import) so
 * `tests/pro-sentry-filter-policy.test.mts` can import the real values rather
 * than re-deriving them from source text — same reason as `./sentry-allow-urls.ts`.
